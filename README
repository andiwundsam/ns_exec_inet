This is an experimental attempt to track the ns_exec binary
used for running a binary in a different Linux Network 
Namespace (NetNS). 

I pulled the existing version off the git repository 
  git://git.sr71.net/~hallyn/cr_tests.git
which seems to track tests for the Linux Checkpoint-Restart
-Project.

Note that there is a much more comprehensive set of userlab
tools available within the lxc project. For running 
Containers/Namespaces in a production environment you will
want to refer to these.
