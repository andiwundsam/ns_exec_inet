This is an experimental attempt to track the ns_exec binary
used for running a binary in a different Linux Network 
Namespace (NetNS). 

Please note that I am NOT the author of ns_exec.c. I just
found it quite difficult to find on the web. The original
link referenced in the tutoril on the lxc website is broken
and there seem to be conflicting patches flying around
-- so I though opening a git repository to track this 
specific program might be useful for me (and possibly others).

I pulled this version of ns_exec off the git repository 
  git://git.sr71.net/~hallyn/cr_tests.git
which seems to track tests for the Linux Checkpoint-Restart
project.

Note that there is a much more comprehensive set of userlab
tools available within the lxc project. For running 
Containers/Namespaces in a production environment you will
want to refer to these.
